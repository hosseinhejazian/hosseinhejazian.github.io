I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Public Impact Analytics Science Lab (PIAS-Lab)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/saghafian/public-impact-analytics-science-lab-pias-lab-harvard), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). Prior to joining Harvard, I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). During my doctoral studies, I honed my expertise in mental healthcare operations management. My research, characterized by its interdisciplinary approach, deftly integrates a diverse array of analytical tools ranging from empirical methods to advanced machine learning techniques. This unique blend of methodologies empowers me to distill complex insights from healthcare data, contributing significantly to the field of healthcare management.
