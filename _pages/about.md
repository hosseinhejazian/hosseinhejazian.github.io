I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Public Impact Analytics Science Lab (PIAS-Lab)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/saghafian/public-impact-analytics-science-lab-pias-lab-harvard), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). Prior to joining Harvard, I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My doctoral thesis, entitled "An Analytical Framework for Mental Healthcare Operations Management", incorporates an interdisciplinary approach and integrates a diverse array of analytical tools ranging from empirical methods to machine learning techniques to distill complex insights from healthcare data.

I am interested in healthcare management and health analytics. My research areas of interest include empirical methods and causal inference. In general, I employ data-driven models to acquire insightful understanding of the complex health systems.
