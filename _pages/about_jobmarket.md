## About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Public Impact Analytics Science Lab (PIAS-Lab)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/saghafian/public-impact-analytics-science-lab-pias-lab-harvard), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), working with Professor [Soroush Saghafian](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/soroush-saghafian). Prior to joining Harvard, I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), advised by Professor [Javad Nasiry](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/javad-nasiry) and Professor [Vedat Verter](https://smith.queensu.ca/faculty_and_research/faculty_list/verter-vedat.php).

## Research Interests
My research sits at the intersection operations management and AI/ML for health-care delivery and the business of health, drawing on empirical research, causal inference, interpretable machine learning, and reinforcement learning to design, evaluate,
and govern decision systems that improve access, quality, and cost.

<!---I am interested in healthcare management and health analytics. My research areas of interest include empirical methods and causal inference. In general, I employ data-driven models to acquire insightful understanding of the complex health systems.--->
